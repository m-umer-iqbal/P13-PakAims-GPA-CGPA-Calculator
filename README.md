## 🧠 Motivation

At the end of every semester, students would manually calculate GPAs using Excel or unreliable online tools that didn’t match our grading system.  
To solve this, I developed **a tool tailored for our university** — making GPA & CGPA calculation simple, accurate, and accessible for everyone.
